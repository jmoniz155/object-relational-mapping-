# object-relational-mapping-

## Description

This object-realtional-mapping application is built using the back end, using sequelize node.js and express. The functionality of this application is very user friendly allowing a retail company to quicky access and modify their store inventory. Which we have established extensions with folders labeled store categories, products and tags.  Within these folders and each category you are able to get all categories, products and tags for easy viewing creating, updating and deleting store inventory.
